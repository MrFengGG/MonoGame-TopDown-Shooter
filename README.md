# MonoGame-TopDown-Shooter

The project is done to get XNA experience in the Visual Studio development environment, is a top-down 2D game where you fight zombies and collect points to buy different equipment to help you kill more and reach different levels, the game uses #C MonoGame to enable the graphics on the screen, Three main functions for game use.
To make a difficult level in the game, the soldier who fights with the zombie has three abilities, each ability has time to be used, the player has to use the abilities at the right time. The warrior has one mission, namely kill all zombies and destroy the space of their vermin to complete the map.
Physics is a basic level, moving the fighting X and Y in relation to input, adding speed with time each time the button presses the correct keys. Two-point vectors are made easy to use and slide in a 2D game.
The animation uses a sprite sheet to get the sprite's drawing on each frame and in time to re-paint the sprite at a particular location from the physicas class.
